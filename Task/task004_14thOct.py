# Task 1:-
# Write a python program to calculate the area of a triangle using the formula ---> area = 1/2 * base * height
# take base = 10 and height = 5, print the result using arithmetic operators
base = 10
height = 5
area = float(1/2 * base * height)
print(f"Area of the triangle is -> {area:.2f}")

# Task 2:-
# Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is greater than 100
number = int(input("enter number: "))
print("Number is greater than 100" if number > 100 else "Number is less than 100")
